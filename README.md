## My process
I started with the mobile design first, then worked my way up to the desktop design. I used a combination of flexbox and grid to achieve the desired layout. I used semantic HTML5 elements to structure the content and CSS custom properties for colors and fonts. I also made sure to use a mobile-first workflow to ensure the site is responsive and looks good on all devices.
